# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch from `main`.
3. Make focused changes.
4. Open a pull request to `main`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and easy to review.
- Include a short summary of gameplay or balance impact.
- If UI/visual behavior changes, include at least one screenshot.
- Ensure the game still runs locally (`python3 -m http.server 5173`).

## Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected and requires PR-based changes.
Direct pushes are blocked by policy.
